# VSDSquadron-Mini-Internship
An internship on RISC-V and VLSI using VSDSquadron Mini Board provided by Kunal Gosh in VLSI System Design (VSD).

## Overview of the internship

The internship is about the two main key take aways:

#### 1. Chip Design

To build the chip, there should be a code specification especially in C model for applications to run. 
In simpler terms,
making of the chip which needs RISC-V processor and it will start from the basic step of specification. 
Specification for RISC-V processor which is used in various applications like  embedded systems, automotive systems, artificial intelligence and many more. 

Note: The specifications can also be application specific, basically the SoC designs which made of ASSIC, microcontroller and microprocessor.

So, VSDSquadron Mini Board provided is the microcontroller which designed to apply for any applications.
The board will have the modelling specification in C which will check whether the application is working or not through testbench which are the test vectors to determine the accuracy and correctness of the model.

Basically, the process involes running simulation for c model and applicatios to present the output.

Therefore, this part is all about
- Running testbench in C language for C model Specifications
- Build processor application specification

#### 2. RTL Architecture

Soft copy of the hardware is written in Hardware Description Language .i.e., processor model is converted into the HDL because application can run faster in HDL compared with a software.

Therefore, this part explains the,
- Soft copy of the hardware using Verilog


And in the final step the output from chip design and RTL Architecture must be equal to show that the desired output from models are achieved.


## Task 1
The task 1 of the internship includes the following
- Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI.
- C Program for sum from one to n.
- Checking the result of C code
- RISC-V Simulator for compiling and running the code
- Assembly language

Overall, it is about writing the C code for sum from one to n followed by compiling and running by RISC-V Simulator.

 The steps to be followed are:
 
#### Step 1: Installation of Oracle VirtualBox.

The VirtualBox is an open source software and an operating system which runs as a physical computer inside the pc/laptop.

#### Step 2: Open the terminal inside the VirtualBox

#### Step 3: To open the editor named leafpad for writing C code.

 Note for the above command explanation:
 - command line cd is to check for home directory.
 - leafpad to open editor.
 - sum_one_to_one is the file name for C code to be written in editor.


#### Step 4: Write the C program for sum of one to n in the terminal 

The leafpad editor opened, write the simple c code for sum of 1 to n,

Save the file in the editor

#### Step 5: To check the result of C code

- Type the below command line to ensure the file is saved.

- The sum for 1 to 5 is 15 which is also verified using calculator
