# VSDSquadron-Mini-Internship
An internship on RISC-V and VLSI using VSDSquadron Miniboard provided by VLSI System Design(VSD). 

## Overview of the internship
The internship provides the Code Specification through C modelling.
It involves two process

Chip Modelling

- Running testbench in C language for C model Specifications
- Build processor application specification

RTL Archietecture


- Soft copy of the hardware using Verilog

## Task 1
The task 1 includes the following
- Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI.
- C Program for sum from one to n.
- Checking the result of C code
- RISC-V Simulator for compiling and running the code
- Assembly language


 The steps to be followed are:
 
#### Step 1: Installation of Oracle VirtualBox, which is an open source virtualization software. The virtual machine have an operating system and used as a physical computer inside your laptop.

#### Step 2: Open the terminal inside the VirtualBox

#### Step 3: Write the command below to open the editor named leafpad to write C code

 Note for the above command explanation:
 - command line cd is to check for home directory
 - leafpad to open editor 
 - sum_one_to_one is the file name C code in editor


#### Step 4: Write the C program for sum of one to n in the terminal

Save the file in the editor

#### Step 5: To check the result of C code

- Type the below command line to ensure the fle is saved.

- This ./a.out command will generate the output 


- The sum for 1 to 5 is 15 which is also verified using calculator
