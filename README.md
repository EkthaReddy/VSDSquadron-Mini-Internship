# vsdsquadron-mini-internship
An internship on RISC-V and VLSI using VSDSquadron Miniboard provided by VLSI System Design(VSD). 

## Overview of internship
The internship provides the Code Specification through C modelling.
It involves two process

Chip Modelling

- Running testbench in C language for C model Specifications
- Build processor application specification

RTL Archietecture


- Soft copy of the hardware using Verilog

## Task 1
Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI.

Step 1: Installation of Oracle VirtualBox, which is an open source virtualization software. The virtual machine have an operating system and used as a physical computer inside your laptop.
